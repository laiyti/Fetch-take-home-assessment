This take-home assessment consists of three sections. For the Python and SQL queries, please refer to _First & Second & Third.ipynb_. I have included all assumptions, explanations, and code comments within the file.

For the email, please refer to _Third - (Email) Communicate with Stakeholders.md_.

If you need any further information, please let me know.
