# Fetch-take-home-assessment

Dear Data Analytics Team,

This take-home assessment consists of three sections:
  - First: explore the data
  - Second: provide SQL queries
  - Third: communicate with stakeholders


For the Python and SQL queries, please refer to "_First & Second & Third.ipynb_". 

I have included all assumptions, explanations, and code comments within the file.

For the email, please refer to "_Third - (Email) Communicate with Stakeholders.md_".

If you need any further information, please let me know.

Thank you for your time in reviewing this. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Yi-Ting Lai
